Bob the Squirrel chronicles the life and times of Bob, a squirrel and Frank, the human he&apos;s taken in as his own. Other ingredients in this comic strip stew include Frank&apos;s girlfriend- the effervescent &quot;foofy coffee chick&quot; Lezley, her daughter Lauren and Maggie, the overly protective pug mix. And to complete the meal, why don&apos;t we throw in Frank&apos;s dog, a jack russell terrier named Lucy---a dog who loves to climb trees, eat nacho chips and generally be the yang to Bob&apos;s ying. There&apos;s something for everyone in Bob the Squirrel... so, make a daily stop to see what&apos;s going on. You will not be disappointed.</string>

                <string>Ginger Meggs, Australia&apos;s most popular and longest-running comic strip, was created in the early 1920s by Jimmy Bancks.

Ginger first appeared in Us Fellers on 13 November 1921, drawn by Bancks.[1] When Bancks died on 1 July 1952 from a heart attack, Ron Vivian took over the strip (1953-1973), followed by Lloyd Piper (1973-1982), James Kemsley (1983-2007) and since 2007, Jason Chatfield...</string>

Litter-droppers, telemarketers and other miscreants are all vaporised painlessly by ray gun, leaving a nicer world. Alex Hallatt came up with Human Cull after seeing someone dropping litter. She didn’t want to confront him, but channelled her frustration into a little green man who could. Alex also has a syndicated comic strip called Arctic Circle and illustrates all sorts of other things that you can see at www.alexhallatt.com. Her first chapter book for kids, FAB (Friends Against Bullying) Club is now out in paperback.</string>

                <string>If by some strange happenstance you have never before seen a Kliban cat drawing, you will instantly recognize that each and every one of them captures the essence of…. cat. A well-established illustrator and cartoonist (Playboy, The New Yorker, Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head, et al) B. Kliban used to devote off-moments in his studio to drawing his felines Nitty, Norton, Burton Rustle and Noko Marie the Snake. An editor friend saw this work and convinced Kliban to let her take it publishers, and in 1975 Workman published CAT, a huge bestseller which inspired an outbreak of cat love that has not abated to this day. That groundbreaking book was followed by more books, and more drawings, which manifested on calendars, cards, mugs, ceramics, clothing – almost 9,000 unique items to date. And the book that started it all is still in print. Cat people of the world, rejoice -- and savor the twice-a-week pleasure of KLIBAN’S CATS.</string>

                <string>Drive down any main street in America and you will undoubtedly pass by at least one, most likely two or three restaurants of the fast food variety. Pushing burgers, tacos, fried chicken and milk shakes, these quick stops have become a familiar source of comfort for travelers far from home and a favorite stop for a late-night snack. Mark Pett’s LUCKY COW delves into the humor of the fast food, minimum wage experience, as teenagers struggle to balance school, their social lives and working at Lucky Cow and the managers hope to keep major disasters to a minimum during peak business hours. It all adds up to a hilarious combination.</string>

                <string>SPEECHLESS is based on the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. It&apos;s mainly visual humor, with the occasional poignant episode thrown in for some relief/balance. At times it may take a bit more observational skills on the part of the reader, but hopefully that very fact will increase the reader&apos;s rewards when they finally &quot;get it&quot;. And appropriately enough, animals which for the most part are &quot;speechless&quot;, will play a majority role in the feature.</string>

                <string>When my melon goes off on a free-style cerebral stroll, untethered from the constraints of boring stuff like logic and reason it sometimes just meanders aimlessly for a while and then eventually returns empty handed. Other times however, it comes back bearing some interesting little nuggets. For example; an idea for a weird invention or toy, a goofy little animation, a quirky memory from childhood or a slightly dark gag cartoon. Who knows what the wandering melon is going to drag home from its journeys?! OK, ok enough of the melon analogies. The Wandering Melon comic is a collection of “art” resulting from whatever ideas pop into my head. This makes it a little hard to categorize but hopefully it will put a smile on your face or at least make you say, “Hmmm, that was odd”. I hope that you all become HARDCORE and REPEAT Melons!</string>

                <string>A rarity in the comics, 9 Chickweed Lane spotlights music and dance with superb artistry that complements Brooke McEldowney&apos;s strong-minded characters. A popular comic strip about three generations of family, 9 Chickweed Lane features strong characters, flights of fancy and an intuitive grasp of all kinds of relationships. The strip was recognized in 2006 for its brilliant artistry and intellectual humor when it was named Best Newspaper Comic Strip by the National Cartoonists Society. The strip appears in 60 newspapers worldwide, including the Los Angeles Times, Houston Chronicle, Calgary Sun and Columbus Dispatch. Central character Edda Burber is dancing to the beat of a different drummer these days as McEldowney focuses 9 Chickweed Lane more on the story of a young woman who moves away from home to perform with a prestigious metropolitan ballet company in New York City. Although it may seem like a completely new strip, 9 Chickweed Lane is peopled with very familiar friends, like furry feline Solange, and Edda&apos;s childhood friend and recent love interest, Amos.</string>

                <string>A 347-acre agricultural and residential estate in Kent, England, hit the market earlier this month for £5.675 million (US$7.25 million), according to a spokesperson for BTF Partnership, the brokerage representing the property.

                    But, if Snowy Hydro's project goes ahead, there are concern boats could be banned from using the waterway while construction works are completed.</string>

                <string>After nearly forty years of marriage, JOAN and JOE CASTLEMAN (Glenn Close and Jonathan Pryce) are complements. Where Joe is casual, Joan is elegant. Where Joe is vain, Joan is self-effacing. And where Joe enjoys his very public role as Great American Novelist, Joan pours her considerable intellect, grace, charm, and diplomacy into the private role of Great Man's Wife. Joe is about to be awarded the Nobel Prize for his acclaimed and prolific body of work. Joe's literary star has blazed since he and Joan first met in the late 1950. THE WIFE interweaves the story of the couple's youthful passion and ambition with a portrait of a marriage, thirty-plus years later - a lifetime's shared compromises, secrets, betrayals, and mutual love.</string>

                <string>Agnes Varda and JR have things in common: their passion for images in general and more particularly questionning the places where they are showed, how they are shared, exposed. Agnès chose cinema. JR chose to create open-air photographic galleries.When Agnès and JR met in 2015, they immediately wanted to work together, shoot a film in France, far from the cities. Random encounters or prepared projects, they will go towards the others and get them to follow them on their trip with JR's photographic truck. The film is also about their friendship that grows during the shooting, between surprises and malice, laughing of their differences.</string>

                <string>Drawn from a cache of personal video recordings from the past 22 years, director Steve Loveridge's Sundance award winning MATANGI / MAYA / M.I.A. is a startlingly personal profile of the critically acclaimed artist, chronicling her remarkable journey from refugee immigrant to pop star. She began as Matangi. Daughter of the founder of Sri Lanka's armed Tamil resistance, she hid from the government in the face of a vicious and bloody civil war. When her family fled to the UK, she became Maya, a precocious and creative immigrant teenager in London. Finally, the world met her as M.I.A. when she emerged on the global stage, having created a mashup, cut-and-paste identity that pulled from every corner of her journey along the way; a sonic sketchbook that blended Tamil politics, art school punk, hip-hop beats and the unwavering, ultra-confident voice of a burgeoning multicultural youth. Never one to compromise on her vision, Maya kept her camera rolling throughout. MATANGI / MAYA / M.I.A. provides unparalleled, intimate access to the artist in her battles with the music industry and mainstream media as her success and fame explodes, becoming one of the most recognizable, outspoken and provocative voices in music today.</string>

"Teen Titans GO! to the Movies" finds our egocentric, wildly satirical Super Heroes in their first feature film extravaganza - a fresh, gleefully clever, kid-appropriately crass and tongue-in-cheek play on the superhero genre, complete with musical numbers. It seems to the Teens that all the major superheroes out there are starring in their own movies everyone but the Teen Titans, that is!  But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick.  If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them.  With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream.  But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously super villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry.  The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line!</string>
