Bob the Squirrel chronicles the life and times of Bob, a squirrel and Frank, the human he&apos;s taken in as his own. Other ingredients in this comic strip stew include Frank&apos;s girlfriend- the effervescent &quot;foofy coffee chick&quot; Lezley, her daughter Lauren and Maggie, the overly protective pug mix. And to complete the meal, why don&apos;t we throw in Frank&apos;s dog, a jack russell terrier named Lucy---a dog who loves to climb trees, eat nacho chips and generally be the yang to Bob&apos;s ying. There&apos;s something for everyone in Bob the Squirrel... so, make a daily stop to see what&apos;s going on. You will not be disappointed.</string>

                <string>Ginger Meggs, Australia&apos;s most popular and longest-running comic strip, was created in the early 1920s by Jimmy Bancks.

While employed at The Bulletin, Bancks submitted cartoons to the Sydney Sunday Sun, where he began his Us Fellers strip in 1921 in the &quot;Sunbeams&quot; section of the Sunday Sun. Ginger first appeared in Us Fellers on 13 November 1921, drawn by Bancks.[1] When Bancks died on 1 July 1952 from a heart attack, Ron Vivian took over the strip (1953-1973), followed by Lloyd Piper (1973-1982), James Kemsley (1983-2007) and since 2007, Jason Chatfield...</string>

Litter-droppers, telemarketers and other miscreants are all vaporised painlessly by ray gun, leaving a nicer world. Alex Hallatt came up with Human Cull after seeing someone dropping litter. She didn’t want to confront him, but channelled her frustration into a little green man who could. Alex also has a syndicated comic strip called Arctic Circle and illustrates all sorts of other things that you can see at www.alexhallatt.com. Her first chapter book for kids, FAB (Friends Against Bullying) Club is now out in paperback.</string>

                <string>If by some strange happenstance you have never before seen a Kliban cat drawing, you will instantly recognize that each and every one of them captures the essence of…. cat. A well-established illustrator and cartoonist (Playboy, The New Yorker, Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head, et al) B. Kliban used to devote off-moments in his studio to drawing his felines Nitty, Norton, Burton Rustle and Noko Marie the Snake. An editor friend saw this work and convinced Kliban to let her take it publishers, and in 1975 Workman published CAT, a huge bestseller which inspired an outbreak of cat love that has not abated to this day. That groundbreaking book was followed by more books, and more drawings, which manifested on calendars, cards, mugs, ceramics, clothing – almost 9,000 unique items to date. And the book that started it all is still in print. Cat people of the world, rejoice -- and savor the twice-a-week pleasure of KLIBAN’S CATS.</string>

                <string>Drive down any main street in America and you will undoubtedly pass by at least one, most likely two or three restaurants of the fast food variety. Pushing burgers, tacos, fried chicken and milk shakes, these quick stops have become a familiar source of comfort for travelers far from home and a favorite stop for a late-night snack. Mark Pett’s LUCKY COW delves into the humor of the fast food, minimum wage experience, as teenagers struggle to balance school, their social lives and working at Lucky Cow and the managers hope to keep major disasters to a minimum during peak business hours. It all adds up to a hilarious combination.</string>

                <string>SPEECHLESS is based on the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. It&apos;s mainly visual humor, with the occasional poignant episode thrown in for some relief/balance. At times it may take a bit more observational skills on the part of the reader, but hopefully that very fact will increase the reader&apos;s rewards when they finally &quot;get it&quot;. And appropriately enough, animals which for the most part are &quot;speechless&quot;, will play a majority role in the feature.</string>

                <string>When my melon goes off on a free-style cerebral stroll, untethered from the constraints of boring stuff like logic and reason it sometimes just meanders aimlessly for a while and then eventually returns empty handed. Other times however, it comes back bearing some interesting little nuggets. For example; an idea for a weird invention or toy, a goofy little animation, a quirky memory from childhood or a slightly dark gag cartoon. Who knows what the wandering melon is going to drag home from its journeys?! OK, ok enough of the melon analogies. The Wandering Melon comic is a collection of “art” resulting from whatever ideas pop into my head. This makes it a little hard to categorize but hopefully it will put a smile on your face or at least make you say, “Hmmm, that was odd”. I hope that you all become HARDCORE and REPEAT Melons!</string>

                <string>A rarity in the comics, 9 Chickweed Lane spotlights music and dance with superb artistry that complements Brooke McEldowney&apos;s strong-minded characters. A popular comic strip about three generations of family, 9 Chickweed Lane features strong characters, flights of fancy and an intuitive grasp of all kinds of relationships. The strip was recognized in 2006 for its brilliant artistry and intellectual humor when it was named Best Newspaper Comic Strip by the National Cartoonists Society. The strip appears in 60 newspapers worldwide, including the Los Angeles Times, Houston Chronicle, Calgary Sun and Columbus Dispatch. Central character Edda Burber is dancing to the beat of a different drummer these days as McEldowney focuses 9 Chickweed Lane more on the story of a young woman who moves away from home to perform with a prestigious metropolitan ballet company in New York City. Although it may seem like a completely new strip, 9 Chickweed Lane is peopled with very familiar friends, like furry feline Solange, and Edda&apos;s childhood friend and recent love interest, Amos.</string>

                <string>A 347-acre agricultural and residential estate in Kent, England, hit the market earlier this month for £5.675 million (US$7.25 million), according to a spokesperson for BTF Partnership, the brokerage representing the property.

                    But, if Snowy Hydro's project goes ahead, there are concern boats could be banned from using the waterway while construction works are completed.</string>
